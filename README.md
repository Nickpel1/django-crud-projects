# django-crud-projects
#Week 5 Task

We would be building a simple song CRUD application. In our models.py file inside the “musicapp” application we created, you are expected to add the following Models and Attributes.

 

Model: Artiste, Song, Lyric
Attributes for “Artiste” : first_name, last_name, age
Attributes for “Song” : title, date released, likes, artiste_id
Attributes for “Lyric”: content, song_id

#Week 6 Task
 
Build a simple REST API to list all the songs in our database and all the artists. Your API should also be able to fetch a particular song, delete and update a particular song.Push your code to the same GitHub repository

 

Note:  When you delete a particular song in the API, All lyrics of that song should be deleted. Also, updating a song simply means updating the song title or the date it was published
